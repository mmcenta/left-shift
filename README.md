![A DQN agent reaching the 2048 tile.](docs/2048.gif)

This repository contains the code used in our project for the INF581: Advanced Topics in A.I. at Ã‰cole Polytechnique. 

In this project, we aim at training a game-playing agent for the 2048 game. We implement an [OpenAI Gym environment](https://github.com) to model the game and use the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm from the Stable Baseline library to train multiple agents varying the states encoding, reward function, network type and structure. Results show that encoding states using one-hot encoding is crucial for better performance. We have also concluded that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are more efficient than Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) for the purpose of this game.

For a more in-depth discussion, give [our report](./docs/report.pdf) a read.

## Project Structure

Below we detail the function of each directory:

* `agents`: contains scripts to train and evaluate agents (more details on the Running subsection), as well as the necessary code implementing custom callbacks and policies;
* `docs`: contains the GIF you saw above and the final report of the project;
* `hyperparams`: contains YAML files detailing hyperparameters for agents (more details on the Hyperparameters subsection);
* `models`: contains pretrained agents;
* `utils`: contains auxiliary scripts for plotting results.

## Instalation

We recommend using a separate Python 3.7 environment for this project (there is an incompatibility issue when trying to load models created using Python 3.7 on other versions). Our dependencies are:

* [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org);
* [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym);
* [TensorFlow 1.15.x](https://www.tensorflow.org) (2.x does not work);
* [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines);
* [gym-text2048](https://github.com/mmcenta/gym-text2048).

A quick way to install them is to run the following command:
`pip install -r [requirements.txt|requirements-gpu.txt]`,
choosing the appropriate file depending on whether you wish to run the models on a CPU or a GPU.

To install the environment, execute the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/mmcenta/gym-text2048
pip install -e gym-text2048
```
## Running

### Interactive player for humans:
```
python agents/play.py
```

### Random agent:
```
python agents/random_agent.py
```

### DQN:

#### To show an agent reaching 2048:
```
python agents/dqn.py --r2048
```

#### To demo pretrained models:
```
python agents/dqn.py -mn MODEL_NAME --demo
```
##### Example:
```
python agents/dqn.py -mn cnn_5l_4_v2 --demo
```
The models are in the folder `models/`.
If the model has `_nohot`, you have to launch it with the `--no-one-hot` flag.

##### Example:
```
python agents/dqn.py -mn cnn_5l_4_v2_nohot --no-one-hot --demo
```

#### To train:
```
python agents/dqn.py -mn MODEL_NAME --train
```

#### To evaluate:
```
python agents/dqn.py -mn MODEL_NAME --eval
```

#### Complete usage:
```
python agents/dqn.py -h
```
```
